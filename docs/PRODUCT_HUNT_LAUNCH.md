## 📖 Full Description (Maker Comment)

### The Problem
We've all been there — a bill slips through the cracks, and suddenly you're hit with late fees. Or worse, your credit takes a hit. Tracking bills across different apps, emails, and mental notes just doesn't work.

### The Solution
Duezo connects to your Gmail and uses AI to automatically find and extract your bills. No manual entry. No spreadsheets. Just connect your email and watch your dashboard fill with beautiful countdown cards.

### Key Features
- **🤖 AI Email Sync** — Connect Gmail and let AI find your bills automatically
- **⏱️ Visual Countdowns** — Cards change color as due dates approach (green → orange → red)
- **🔔 Smart Reminders** — Get notified 7, 3, and 1 day before each bill
- **📅 Calendar View** — See all bills on a monthly calendar
- **📊 Analytics** — Track spending trends and category breakdowns
- **🔄 Recurring Bills** — Auto-generate weekly, biweekly, monthly, or yearly bills
- **🌙 Dark Mode** — Easy on the eyes, follows system preference

### Pricing
- **Free** — Up to 5 bills, 1 Gmail sync to try it out
- **Pro ($4.99/mo)** — Unlimited bills, unlimited syncs, calendar, analytics

### Origin Story
I switched to iPhone and couldn't find a bill tracker that wasn't either ugly, overcomplicated, or trying to be a full budgeting app. I just wanted to know: what bills are coming up, and when are they due? So I built Duezo.

## 💬 Prepared Responses

### "How is this different from Mint/YNAB?"
> Great question! Mint and YNAB are full budgeting apps — they track every transaction, create budgets, etc. Duezo is laser-focused on one thing: knowing when your bills are due. No bank connections, no transaction tracking, just bill due dates with beautiful visual countdowns.

### "Is my email data safe?"
> Absolutely. We only read emails that look like bills (using AI detection), and we never store your full emails. Just the bill name, amount, and due date. Your data is encrypted, and you can disconnect Gmail anytime.

### "Why not just use calendar reminders?"
> You could! But you'd have to manually enter every bill, update amounts when they change, and remember to mark them paid. Duezo automates all of that — it finds bills in your email, tracks amount changes, and auto-generates recurring bills.
