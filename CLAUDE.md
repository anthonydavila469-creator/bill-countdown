## Working Principles

1. **Think First, Code Second** - Always think through the problem and read the codebase for relevant files before making changes.

2. **Check In Before Major Changes** - Before making any major changes, check in with me to verify the plan.

3. **High-Level Explanations** - Every step of the way, provide a high-level explanation of what changes were made.

4. **Simplicity Above All** - Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

5. **Maintain Architecture Documentation** - Keep a documentation file that describes how the architecture of the app works inside and out.

6. **No Speculation** - Never speculate about code you have not opened. If I reference a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make claims about code before investigating unless certain of the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.

## Design & UI

Always use the `/frontend-design` skill for all UI and frontend work. This ensures production-grade, polished interfaces with high design quality.
